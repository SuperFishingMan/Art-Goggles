# Art-Goggles

Art Goggles achieves a method of augmented reality by using the HTC Vive's front facing camera as input into Windows Spout enabled VJ programs, like Resolume Arena. Resolume shares the newly composited texture back into VR. This way you can see reality through the VR headset, with an overlay of graphical effects.

The program is written in Unity3D.
